## Passive Network Attacks

Passive network attacks are a type of cyberattack where the attacker's primary goal is to gather information or monitor network activity without being detected.

Some examples of passive network attacks include:

üîé Sniffing is when an attacker uses software to intercept and read network traffic to steal sensitive data or access a target's system.

üîé Traffic analysis is when an attacker analyzes network traffic to gather information about the target's systems, network topology, and users.

üîé Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks occur when an attacker intercepts and alters network traffic to gather information or gain unauthorized access to systems.

Passive network attacks are often more challenging to detect than active attacks since they don't cause the same level of disruption to network traffic. Regardless, they are a serious matter and can be detrimental. Using strong encryption and monitoring network traffic regularly for signs of suspicious activity can help prevent passive network attacks.

## Active Network Attacks

Active network attacks are a type of cyberattack where the attacker's primary goal is to gain unauthorized access and disrupt or damage a target's network or systems.

Some examples of active network attacks include:

üìç Denial of Service (DoS) attacks occur when an attacker floods a network with an overwhelming volume of traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.

üìç Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a type of DoS attack where the traffic comes from multiple compromised computers. Groups of these compromised computers are known as botnets.

üìç Exploitation occurs when an attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability in a network to gain unauthorized access.

üìç Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) exist when an attacker establishes a long-term presence on a network and uses that access to steal sensitive information or cause damage.

Active network attacks can cause significant damage to networks or systems. They can result in data loss, system downtime, and financial loss. It's important to update software and systems and use intrusion detection and prevention solutions to prevent active network attacks. Organizations should have an incident response plan in place, so they know precisely how to respond to a cyberattack.



# Wireless

## Evil twin
   
## Rogue access point

## Bluesnarfing
    
## Bluejacking
    
## Disassociation
    
## Jamming
   
## Radio frequency identification (RFID)
    
## Near-field communication (NFC)
    
## Initialization vector (IV)

IV is a method used to decrypt wireless traffic.

Attackers will read the plaintext of a wireless packet before computing the key stream of the RC4 hash. 
- Note: wireless traffic using the same IV can be decrypted by attackers.

# On-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle attack/man-in-the-browser attack)

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks occur when an attacker intercepts and alters network traffic to gather information or gain unauthorized access to systems.

# Layer 2 attacks

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning

## Media access control (MAC) flooding

## MAC cloning

# Domain name system (DNS)

## Domain hijacking
   
## DNS poisoning
   
## Uniform Resource Locator (URL) redirection

## Domain reputation

# Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)

## Network
    
## Application
   
## Operational technology (OT)

# Malicious code or script execution

## PowerShell

## Python

## Bash

## Macros

## Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
