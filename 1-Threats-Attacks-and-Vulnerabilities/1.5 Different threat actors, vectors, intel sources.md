# 1.5 Explain different threat actors, vectors, and intelligence sources

# Actors and threats

## Threat actors

Anyone, or anything, that has a motive to cause harm to an organization's IT infrastructure. 

Threat actors may be a hacker, nation-state, criminal syndicate, script kiddie, or any other entity that poses a threat to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a computer system or network. Many different techniques are used to carry out attacks, like phishing, malware, social engineering, and exploiting software vulnerabilities. 

## Advanced persistent threat (APT)

🕵️ Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are cyberattacks by highly skilled and well-funded groups, often tied to nation-states. These attacks are typically targeted at specific organizations or individuals to steal sensitive information or disrupt operations over an extended time.

## Insider threats

🕵️ Insider threats refer to individuals within an organization who use their access to sensitive information or systems to cause harm or steal data. These individuals can include employees, contractors, or business partners.

## State actors

🕵️ State actors are nation-states or government-affiliated groups that carry out cyberattacks. These attacks can be motivated by various factors, such as espionage, political gain, or military advantage.

## Hacktivists

🕵️ Hacktivists are individuals or groups that use hacking to further a political or social agenda. They may carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, website defacement, or data breaches to make a statement or draw attention to a cause.

## Script kiddies

🕵️ Script kiddies use pre-existing scripts or tools to carry out attacks rather than developing their own. They typically lack the technical skill of more advanced attackers and may be motivated by mischief or a desire to cause disruption.

## Criminal syndicates

🕵️ Criminal syndicates are organized groups that use hacking to make money through activities such as theft of financial information, extortion, or ransomware.

# Hackers

## Authorized

🕵️ Authorized hackers, also known as penetration testers or ethical hackers, have been given written consent to hack systems or networks to identify vulnerabilities.

## Unauthorized

🕵️ Unauthorized hackers, also known as bad actors, are individuals or groups that hack without permission. They may be motivated by financial gain, political agenda, or personal vendettas.

## Semi-authorized

🕵️ Semi-authorized hackers are individuals who have permission to access specific systems or networks but use that access to carry out unauthorized activities.

## Shadow IT

🕵️ Shadow IT refers to using apps within an organization that the IT department has not approved or does not approve.

## Competitors

🕵️ Competitors refer to rival companies or organizations that use cyber espionage to gain an unfair advantage over their rivals by stealing sensitive information, like trade secrets, financial information, and other confidential data.
