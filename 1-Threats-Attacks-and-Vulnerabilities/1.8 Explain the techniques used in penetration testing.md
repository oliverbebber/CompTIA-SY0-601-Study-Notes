# 1.8 Explain the techniques used in penetration testing

# Penetration testing
    
## Known environment
📚 A known environment test aims to identify any new vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that have surfaced since the last test. Penetration testers know about the network topology, IP addresses, open ports and services, and vulnerabilities in a known environment penetration test.
## Unknown environment
🕵️ An unknown environment test aims to simulate a real-world attack scenario in which the tester has to perform reconnaissance and mapping of the target network to identify vulnerabilities. In these tests, the pentester has minimal or no knowledge of the network and system infrastructure.
## Partially known environment
🗒A partially known environment test aims to identify any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the known and unknown parts of the network. Penetration testers have some information about specific network segments or systems but a partial understanding of the entire network.
## Rules of engagement
🤝 Rules of engagement (ROE) outline the scope and limits of a penetration test. These rules help protect the organization by clearly defining the test's scope and limitations and ensuring that the tester does not cause any unintended harm or damage to systems or data. It is crucial to have clear and agreed-upon ROE before starting any pen-testing engagement to ensure clarity and understanding between the tester and the organization.
