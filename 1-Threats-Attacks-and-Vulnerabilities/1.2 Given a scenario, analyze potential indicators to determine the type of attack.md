# Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is any software designed to harm or exploit computer systems. There are many different types of malware, each with its unique characteristics and attack methods.
## Virus
ü¶† Virus: A virus attaches itself to a legitimate file and replicates itself when the infected file is executed. Once infected, the virus can spread to other computers through shared networks or removable media.

## Ransomware
üí∞Ransomware: Ransomware is malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attackers. Ransomware is typically spread through phishing emails or malicious websites.
## Trojans
üê¥ Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file, but once executed, it can perform malicious actions, such as stealing personal information or creating a back door for attackers to gain access to the infected computer.

## Worms
üêõ Worms: A worm is a type of malware that can replicate and spread itself to other computers without needing a host program or file. Worms can spread through networks, email attachments, and instant messaging.
