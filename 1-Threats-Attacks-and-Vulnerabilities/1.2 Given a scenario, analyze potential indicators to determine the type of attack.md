# 1.2 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack

# Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is any software designed to harm or exploit computer systems. There are many different types of malware, each with its unique characteristics and attack methods.
## Virus
ü¶† Virus: A virus attaches itself to a legitimate file and replicates itself when the infected file is executed. Once infected, the virus can spread to other computers through shared networks or removable media.

## Ransomware
üí∞Ransomware: Ransomware is malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attackers. Ransomware is typically spread through phishing emails or malicious websites.
## Trojans
üê¥ Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file, but once executed, it can perform malicious actions, such as stealing personal information or creating a back door for attackers to gain access to the infected computer.

## Worms
üêõ Worms: A worm is a type of malware that can replicate and spread itself to other computers without needing a host program or file. Worms can spread through networks, email attachments, and instant messaging.
## Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)
Software programs that may contain features or functionality that are unwanted, unnecessary, or potentially harmful to the user. PUPs can be bundled with other software, downloaded from unreliable websites, or installed through malicious means, such as drive-by downloads or phishing scams.

PUPs may include adware, toolbars, browser extensions, and other types of software that install additional components or change the behavior of a computer or a web browser without the user's explicit consent. These programs may cause pop-up advertisements, slow down the performance of the computer, collect sensitive information, or redirect the user's browser to unwanted websites. 

To avoid PUPs, it is important to carefully review the installation process of any software, to only download software from reputable sources, and to install an antivirus program and keep it updated.

## Spyware
Malicious software designed to collect sensitive information from a computer or network without the user's knowledge. Spyware can be installed on a computer using a variety of methods, including drive-by downloads, email attachments, or by exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once installed, spyware can track a user's activity online, steal login credentials and financial data, monitor keystrokes, and take screenshots. 

- Some spyware can control webcams, including USB webcams and webcams built-in on laptops.
- Some forms of spyware can manipulate the behavior of a computer and it's browser, causing a user to be redirected to malicious sites.
- Spyware can be difficult to detect and to remove, which poses a serious threat to privacy and security. 

Keeping software up to date, using a trusted antivirus app, and downloading trusted software can help protect users from spyware.

## Remote access Trojan (RAT)

## Rootkit
‚öôÔ∏è Rootkits: A rootkit is a type of malware designed to hide the presence of other malware, such as viruses or Trojan horses, by modifying the operating system or hiding files. Rootkits can be challenging to detect and remove.

# Physical attacks
Physical attacks on computer systems can include things like:

üìå Tampering with or damaging equipment to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to a system

üìå Eavesdropping on network communications

üìå Social engineering tactics to gain physical access to a system or facility

Organizations can use a combination of the following measures to prevent physical attacks:

üîê Restrict physical access to sensitive areas and equipment through the use of security personnel, security cameras, and access controls like keycards or biometric scanners

üîê Regularly inspect and monitor equipment for signs of tampering or damage.

üîê Implement security protocols for handling and disposing of sensitive data and hardware, such as hard drives

üîê Provide security and awareness training for employees, contractors, and third-party vendors.

üîê Create incident response and disaster recovery plans.

It's important to remember that physical security is just as important as network security when defending against unauthorized access to computer systems.
