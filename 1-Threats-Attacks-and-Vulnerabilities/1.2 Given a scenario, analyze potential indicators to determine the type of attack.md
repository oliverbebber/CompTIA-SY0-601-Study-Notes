# Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is any software designed to harm or exploit computer systems. There are many different types of malware, each with its unique characteristics and attack methods.
## Virus
🦠 Virus: A virus attaches itself to a legitimate file and replicates itself when the infected file is executed. Once infected, the virus can spread to other computers through shared networks or removable media.

## Ransomware
💰Ransomware: Ransomware is malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attackers. Ransomware is typically spread through phishing emails or malicious websites.
## Trojans
🐴 Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file, but once executed, it can perform malicious actions, such as stealing personal information or creating a back door for attackers to gain access to the infected computer.

## Worms
🐛 Worms: A worm is a type of malware that can replicate and spread itself to other computers without needing a host program or file. Worms can spread through networks, email attachments, and instant messaging.

## Logic bombs

## Spyware

## Keyloggers

## Remote access Trojan (RAT)

## Rootkit
⚙️ Rootkits: A rootkit is a type of malware designed to hide the presence of other malware, such as viruses or Trojan horses, by modifying the operating system or hiding files. Rootkits can be challenging to detect and remove.

# Physical attacks
Physical attacks on computer systems can include things like:

📌 Tampering with or damaging equipment to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to a system

📌 Eavesdropping on network communications

📌 Social engineering tactics to gain physical access to a system or facility

Organizations can use a combination of the following measures to prevent physical attacks:

🔐 Restrict physical access to sensitive areas and equipment through the use of security personnel, security cameras, and access controls like keycards or biometric scanners

🔐 Regularly inspect and monitor equipment for signs of tampering or damage.

🔐 Implement security protocols for handling and disposing of sensitive data and hardware, such as hard drives

🔐 Provide security and awareness training for employees, contractors, and third-party vendors.

🔐 Create incident response and disaster recovery plans.

It's important to remember that physical security is just as important as network security when defending against unauthorized access to computer systems.
