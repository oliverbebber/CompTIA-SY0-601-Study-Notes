#1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques

Social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudlent purposes.

🎣 𝗣𝗵𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 is a method used to trick people into giving out sensitive information such as login credentials, financial or personal information. Often phishing attempts are made via an email that appears to be from a legit company and asking the recipient to click a link or open an attachment. When the user clicks on the link, it directs them to a fake website that looks real, which prompts them to enter their login information. Attackers can then use this info to access the person's accounts and commit fraud.
    📖 By definition: the fraudulent practice of sending emails or other messages purporting to be from reputable companies to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

Types of phishing attacks:
📱 𝗦𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 is a method that uses text messages to trick people into giving out sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link. Like phishing, smishing attacks often try to mimic a legit company. They may use urgent or threatening language to get the recipient to act quickly without thinking. An attacker might send a text message claiming to be from a bank and ask the recipient to click on a link to update their account info or verify a recent purchase. If the user clicks on the link, they are taken to a fake website and asked to enter their login info. Or worse, the link may install malware on the user's device.

☎️ 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴, also known as voice phishing, is a method that uses phone calls to trick people into giving out sensitive information or transferring money. Like phishing and smishing, vishing attacks often try to mimic a legitimate organization or company. They may use urgent or threatening language to get the recipient to act quickly without thinking. An attacker might call claiming to be from their bank. They may claim suspicious activity on their account and ask for their online banking username, password, or other sensitive information to verify their identity. Alternatively, the attacker might tell the person they owe money and need to pay immediately to avoid legal consequences.
