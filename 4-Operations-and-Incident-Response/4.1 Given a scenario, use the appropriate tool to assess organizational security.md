Bad File Generator or Big File Generator is used for data sanitization. This tool is designed to replaced sensitive data, like credit card numbers, SSNs, emails, passwords, etc. with generic placeholders in large data sets.

This process may also be referred to as "redacting" or "scrubbing".

Note: this tool should **NOT** be used as a substitute for proper security practices. It should be used as an added layer of security with other measures such as encryption and access controls.
