chmod is a Linux/Unix command that means change mode. 

This command is used to change the permissions of files or directories.

Every file and directory has a set of permissions that dictact who can read, write, and execute that file/directory. The permissions are represented by a set of three values for the file owner, the group owner, and other users.

- Read permissions: represented by `r` - allows a user to read the file or list the contents of a directory.
- Write permissions: represented by `w` - allows a user to modify the file or create, rename, or delete files in the directory.
- Execute permissions: represented by `x` - allows a user to execute the file or access the contents of a directory.

Bad File Generator or Big File Generator is used for data sanitization. This tool is designed to replaced sensitive data, like credit card numbers, SSNs, emails, passwords, etc. with generic placeholders in large data sets.

This process may also be referred to as "redacting" or "scrubbing".

Note: this tool should **NOT** be used as a substitute for proper security practices. It should be used as an added layer of security with other measures such as encryption and access controls.
