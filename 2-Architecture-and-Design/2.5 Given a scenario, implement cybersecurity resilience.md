## Network

## Load balancers

Load balancers are devices, or software, that distributes network traffic across multiple resources, or servers, to improve performance, increase reliability, and avoid overload. 

Load balancers help ensure high availability.

- Round-robin scheduling distributes traffic equally across all available servers.
- Weighted round-robin scheduling allocates traffic based on the server's processing power or available memory.

Load balancers are typically used in large-scale web apps and other high-traffic platforms to ensure the site/service remains available, even if one or more server fails.
