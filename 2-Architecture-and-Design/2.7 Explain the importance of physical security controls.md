# 2.7 Explain the importance of physical security controls

## Bollards/barricades

## Access control vestibules
üö™ Access controls limit access to a building or specific areas only to authorized personnel to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. Access control systems work hand in hand with employee badges.
## Badges
üìõ Employee badges are an essential security control as they can verify identity and be used to control access to specific areas within a building. Badges can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems and help quickly identify personnel in the event of a security incident.
## Alarms
‚è∞ Alarms are essential to security because they can alert personnel to potential intrusions or attempted theft of equipment or data. Alarm systems can help minimize the potential damage caused.
## Signage
‚ö†Ô∏è Posting signage can indicate the presence of security systems, such as CCTV cameras, access control systems, and alarms. This can help to deter potential intruders and can also help to guide authorized personnel to the appropriate locations.
# Cameras
üìπ Surveillance systems, such as CCTV cameras, can be used to monitor activity within a facility and can be used to deter or detect intrusions or other security breaches. Most surveillance systems are capable of motion detection, and some are capable of object detection, including facial recognition and license plate reading, thanks to AI.
