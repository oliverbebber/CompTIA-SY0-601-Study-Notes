## DNS sinkhole

A DNS sinkhole is used to block malicious traffic, or to prevent access to specific domains. These are also referred to as blackholes, sinkhole servers, or DNSBL (DNS based blackhole lists).

DNS sinkholes redirect DNS requests for specific domains to a non-existent server. When a user, or system, tries to access a website that has been flagged as malicious or unwanted, the sinkhole intercepts the request.

This technique can provide several benefits:

- Restricting users from accessing known malicious websites
- Preventing phishing attacks
- Preventing the spread of malware
- Blocking access to websites with hate speech or adult content
- Reducing or blocking ads
